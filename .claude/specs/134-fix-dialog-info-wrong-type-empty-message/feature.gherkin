@regression
Feature: Dialog info returns correct type and message for open dialogs
  The dialog info command previously returned type "unknown" and message ""
  for open dialogs because drain_dialog_event() used non-blocking try_recv()
  which raced against event delivery through the WebSocket pipeline.
  This was fixed by converting drain_dialog_event() to async with a
  timeout-bounded recv() that waits for the event to arrive.

  Background:
    Given chrome-cli is built

  # --- Bug Is Fixed ---

  @regression
  Scenario: AC1 — dialog info returns correct type and message for alert
    Given a page has triggered an alert dialog with message "hello"
    When I run "chrome-cli dialog info"
    Then the output JSON should contain "open" equal to true
    And the output JSON should contain "type" equal to "alert"
    And the output JSON should contain "message" equal to "hello"
    And the exit code should be 0

  @regression
  Scenario: AC2 — dialog info reports confirm dialogs correctly
    Given a page has triggered a confirm dialog with message "proceed?"
    When I run "chrome-cli dialog info"
    Then the output JSON should contain "open" equal to true
    And the output JSON should contain "type" equal to "confirm"
    And the output JSON should contain "message" equal to "proceed?"
    And the exit code should be 0

  @regression
  Scenario: AC4 — dialog handle returns correct type and message
    Given a page has triggered an alert dialog with message "test"
    When I run "chrome-cli dialog handle accept"
    Then the output JSON should contain "dialog_type" equal to "alert"
    And the output JSON should contain "message" equal to "test"
    And the exit code should be 0

  # --- Related Behavior Still Works ---

  @regression
  Scenario: AC3 — dialog info still works when no dialog is open
    Given no dialog is currently open
    When I run "chrome-cli dialog info"
    Then the output JSON should contain "open" equal to false
    And the exit code should be 0
