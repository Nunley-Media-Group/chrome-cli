Feature: Console Message Reading with Filtering
  As a developer or automation engineer
  I want to read and monitor browser console messages via the CLI
  So that I can debug web applications and monitor for errors from scripts

  # --- CLI Argument Validation (no Chrome required) ---

  Scenario: Console help lists read and follow subcommands
    Given chrome-cli is built
    When I run "chrome-cli console --help"
    Then the exit code should be 0
    And stdout should contain "read"
    And stdout should contain "follow"

  Scenario: Console read help shows all flags
    Given chrome-cli is built
    When I run "chrome-cli console read --help"
    Then the exit code should be 0
    And stdout should contain "--type"
    And stdout should contain "--errors-only"
    And stdout should contain "--limit"
    And stdout should contain "--page"
    And stdout should contain "--include-preserved"

  Scenario: Console follow help shows all flags
    Given chrome-cli is built
    When I run "chrome-cli console follow --help"
    Then the exit code should be 0
    And stdout should contain "--type"
    And stdout should contain "--errors-only"
    And stdout should contain "--timeout"

  Scenario: Conflicting flags --type and --errors-only on read
    Given chrome-cli is built
    When I run "chrome-cli console read --type error --errors-only"
    Then the exit code should be nonzero
    And stderr should contain "cannot be used with"

  Scenario: Conflicting flags --type and --errors-only on follow
    Given chrome-cli is built
    When I run "chrome-cli console follow --type error --errors-only"
    Then the exit code should be nonzero
    And stderr should contain "cannot be used with"

  # --- Console Read: List Mode ---

  Scenario: List console messages from current page
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a page has generated console messages
    When I run "chrome-cli console read"
    Then the output is a JSON array
    And each message contains "id" field
    And each message contains "type" field
    And each message contains "text" field
    And each message contains "timestamp" field
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: Console read with no messages returns empty array
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a page has generated no console messages
    When I run "chrome-cli console read"
    Then the output is "[]"
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: Default limit is 50 messages
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a page has generated 100 console messages
    When I run "chrome-cli console read"
    Then at most 50 messages are returned
    And the exit code should be 0

  # --- Console Read: Type Filtering ---

  Scenario: Filter console messages by single type
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a page has generated log, warn, and error messages
    When I run "chrome-cli console read --type error"
    Then all returned messages have type "error"
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: Filter console messages by multiple types
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a page has generated log, warn, and error messages
    When I run "chrome-cli console read --type error,warn"
    Then all returned messages have type "error" or "warn"
    And no returned messages have type "log"
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: Use errors-only shorthand filter
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a page has generated log and error messages
    When I run "chrome-cli console read --errors-only"
    Then all returned messages have type "error" or "assert"
    And the exit code should be 0

  # --- Console Read: Pagination ---

  Scenario: Limit number of returned messages
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a page has generated more than 10 console messages
    When I run "chrome-cli console read --limit 5"
    Then at most 5 messages are returned
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: Paginate through console messages
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a page has generated 20 console messages
    When I run "chrome-cli console read --limit 10 --page 1"
    Then messages 10 through 19 are returned
    And the exit code should be 0

  # --- Console Read: Navigation Awareness ---

  Scenario: Include messages from previous navigations
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And console messages exist from a previous navigation
    When I run "chrome-cli console read --include-preserved"
    Then messages from both current and previous navigations are included
    And the exit code should be 0

  # --- Console Read: Tab Targeting ---

  Scenario: Target a specific tab for console read
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And multiple tabs are open
    When I run "chrome-cli console read --tab 1"
    Then console messages from tab 1 are returned
    And the exit code should be 0

  # --- Console Read: Detail Mode ---

  Scenario: Get detailed information about a specific message
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And console messages exist
    When I run "chrome-cli console read 0"
    Then the output contains "args" field
    And the output contains "stackTrace" field
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: Detail view stack trace includes source location
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a console message with a stack trace exists
    When I run "chrome-cli console read 0"
    Then the stack trace contains "file" field
    And the stack trace contains "line" field
    And the stack trace contains "column" field
    And the stack trace contains "functionName" field

  Scenario: Stack traces limited to 50 frames
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a console message has a stack trace exceeding 50 frames
    When I run "chrome-cli console read 0"
    Then the stack trace contains at most 50 frames

  Scenario: Console read with invalid message ID errors
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    When I run "chrome-cli console read 9999"
    Then the exit code should be nonzero
    And stderr should contain "not found"

  # --- Console Read: Error Cause Chains ---

  Scenario: Error cause chains for uncaught exceptions
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a page has thrown an uncaught exception with a cause chain
    When I run "chrome-cli console read"
    Then the error message includes the cause chain
    And the exit code should be 0

  # --- Console Follow: Streaming ---

  Scenario: Stream console messages in real-time
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a page is loaded
    When I run "chrome-cli console follow --timeout 2000"
    And the page generates a console.log message
    Then the message is printed to stdout
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: Stream with type filter
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a page is loaded
    When I run "chrome-cli console follow --type error --timeout 2000"
    And the page generates a console.log and a console.error
    Then only the error message is printed to stdout

  Scenario: Stream with errors-only filter
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a page is loaded
    When I run "chrome-cli console follow --errors-only --timeout 2000"
    And the page generates a console.log and a console.error
    Then only the error message is printed to stdout

  Scenario: Stream with timeout exits after specified duration
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a page is loaded
    When I run "chrome-cli console follow --timeout 1000"
    Then the command exits after approximately 1000ms
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: Stream returns non-zero exit code on error messages
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a page is loaded
    When I run "chrome-cli console follow --timeout 2000"
    And the page generates a console.error message
    Then the exit code should be nonzero

  # --- Plain Text Output ---

  Scenario: Plain text output for console read list
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And a page has generated console messages
    When I run "chrome-cli console read --plain"
    Then the output is plain text with message type prefixes
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: Plain text output for console read detail
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled
    And console messages exist
    When I run "chrome-cli console read 0 --plain"
    Then the output is plain text with full message details
    And the exit code should be 0
