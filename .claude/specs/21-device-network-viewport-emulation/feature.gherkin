Feature: Device, network, and viewport emulation
  As a developer or automation engineer
  I want to emulate different devices, network conditions, geolocations, and color schemes
  So that I can test web page behavior under various device and network constraints

  Background:
    Given Chrome is running with CDP enabled

  # --- Network Emulation ---

  Scenario Outline: Set network emulation profile
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --network <profile>"
    Then the JSON output should contain "network" set to "<profile>"
    And the exit code should be 0

    Examples:
      | profile  |
      | offline  |
      | slow-4g  |
      | 4g       |
      | 3g       |
      | none     |

  Scenario: Disable network throttling with none profile
    Given network throttling is set to "slow-4g"
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --network none"
    Then the JSON output should contain "network" set to "none"
    And the exit code should be 0

  # --- CPU Throttling ---

  Scenario: Set CPU throttling rate
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --cpu 4"
    Then the JSON output should contain "cpu" set to 4
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: CPU throttling rate out of range produces error
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --cpu 0"
    Then the exit code should be non-zero
    And stderr should contain "valid range"

  # --- Geolocation ---

  Scenario: Set geolocation override
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --geolocation 37.7749,-122.4194"
    Then the JSON output should contain "geolocation" with "latitude" 37.7749
    And the JSON output should contain "geolocation" with "longitude" -122.4194
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: Clear geolocation override
    Given geolocation is overridden to "37.7749,-122.4194"
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --no-geolocation"
    Then the JSON output should contain "geolocation" set to null
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: Invalid geolocation format produces error
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --geolocation not-a-coord"
    Then the exit code should be non-zero
    And stderr should contain "LAT,LONG"

  # --- User Agent ---

  Scenario: Set custom user agent
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --user-agent 'Mozilla/5.0 Custom'"
    Then the JSON output should contain "userAgent" set to "Mozilla/5.0 Custom"
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: Reset user agent to default
    Given user agent is overridden to "Mozilla/5.0 Custom"
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --no-user-agent"
    Then the JSON output should contain "userAgent" set to null
    And the exit code should be 0

  # --- Color Scheme ---

  Scenario Outline: Set color scheme emulation
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --color-scheme <scheme>"
    Then the JSON output should contain "colorScheme" set to "<scheme>"
    And the exit code should be 0

    Examples:
      | scheme |
      | dark   |
      | light  |
      | auto   |

  # --- Viewport ---

  Scenario: Set viewport dimensions
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --viewport 375x667"
    Then the JSON output should contain "viewport" with "width" 375
    And the JSON output should contain "viewport" with "height" 667
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: Invalid viewport format produces error
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --viewport badformat"
    Then the exit code should be non-zero
    And stderr should contain "WIDTHxHEIGHT"

  # --- Device Scale ---

  Scenario: Set device scale factor
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --device-scale 2"
    Then the JSON output should contain "deviceScaleFactor" set to 2.0
    And the exit code should be 0

  # --- Mobile Emulation ---

  Scenario: Enable mobile emulation
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --mobile --viewport 375x667"
    Then the JSON output should contain "mobile" set to true
    And the JSON output should contain "viewport" with "width" 375
    And the exit code should be 0

  # --- Combined Settings ---

  Scenario: Combine multiple emulation settings
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --network slow-4g --viewport 375x667 --mobile --color-scheme dark"
    Then the JSON output should contain "network" set to "slow-4g"
    And the JSON output should contain "viewport" with "width" 375
    And the JSON output should contain "mobile" set to true
    And the JSON output should contain "colorScheme" set to "dark"
    And the exit code should be 0

  # --- Tab Targeting ---

  Scenario: Target specific tab for emulation
    Given multiple tabs are open
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --network 3g --tab 2"
    Then the JSON output should contain "network" set to "3g"
    And the exit code should be 0

  # --- Reset ---

  Scenario: Reset all emulation overrides
    Given emulation overrides are active
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate reset"
    Then the JSON output should contain "reset" set to true
    And the exit code should be 0

  # --- Status ---

  Scenario: Show current emulation status
    Given emulation overrides are active
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate status"
    Then the JSON output should contain "viewport"
    And the JSON output should contain "userAgent"
    And the exit code should be 0

  # --- Page Resize Shorthand ---

  Scenario: Page resize shorthand
    When I run "chrome-cli page resize 1280x720"
    Then the JSON output should contain "width" set to 1280
    And the JSON output should contain "height" set to 720
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: Page resize with invalid format
    When I run "chrome-cli page resize badformat"
    Then the exit code should be non-zero
    And stderr should contain "WIDTHxHEIGHT"

  # --- Invalid Network Profile ---

  Scenario: Invalid network profile produces error
    When I run "chrome-cli emulate set --network invalid-profile"
    Then the exit code should be non-zero
    And stderr should contain "possible values"
