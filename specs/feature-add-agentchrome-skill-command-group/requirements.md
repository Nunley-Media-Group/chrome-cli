# Requirements: Add agentchrome skill Command Group

**Issues**: #172, #214, #263
**Date**: 2026-04-24
**Status**: Draft
**Author**: Claude (AI-assisted)

---

## User Story

**As an** AI agent or developer using an agentic coding tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Aider, Continue.dev, GitHub Copilot)
**I want** to run a single command that installs a concise agentchrome skill/instruction into my agentic tool at the user level
**So that** the AI agent automatically knows when to use agentchrome and how to discover its capabilities through the CLI's own help system

---

## Background

agentchrome is an AI-native CLI tool with rich built-in help (`--help`, `capabilities`, `examples`, `man`), but agentic coding tools have no built-in awareness that agentchrome exists or when to reach for it. Each major agentic platform supports user-level persistent instructions or skills. A `skill install` command would detect the running agentic environment and install a minimal pointer skill — telling the agent only: (1) what agentchrome is for, (2) when to use it, and (3) how to invoke its help to discover functionality. The skill is a signpost, not a manual — it must NOT duplicate content already available through CLI help.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**IMPORTANT: Each criterion becomes a Gherkin BDD test scenario.**

### AC1: Auto-detected installation

**Given** an agentic coding tool (e.g., Claude Code) is the parent environment
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill install`
**Then** the command detects the active tool, installs the concise agentchrome skill to its user-level location, and prints a JSON result on stdout confirming the tool name and installed file path

**Example**:
- Given: `CLAUDE_CODE` env var is set
- When: `agentchrome skill install`
- Then: stdout contains `{"tool":"claude-code","path":"~/.claude/skills/agentchrome/SKILL.md","action":"installed"}`

### AC2: Explicit tool targeting

**Given** a user wants to install for a specific tool regardless of environment
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill install --tool cursor`
**Then** the skill is installed to the correct location for Cursor and a JSON confirmation is returned on stdout

**Example**:
- Given: No particular agentic environment is active
- When: `agentchrome skill install --tool cursor`
- Then: stdout contains `{"tool":"cursor","path":".cursor/rules/agentchrome.mdc","action":"installed"}`

### AC3: List supported tools

**Given** a user wants to know which tools are supported
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill list`
**Then** a JSON array of supported tool objects is returned on stdout, each containing the tool name, detection method, and install path

**Example**:
- When: `agentchrome skill list`
- Then: stdout contains a JSON array with entries like `{"name":"claude-code","detection":"CLAUDE_CODE env var or 'claude' parent process","path":"~/.claude/skills/agentchrome/SKILL.md"}`

### AC4: Uninstall

**Given** an agentchrome skill was previously installed for a detected tool
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill uninstall`
**Then** the installed file is removed and a JSON confirmation is returned on stdout

**Example**:
- Given: Skill was installed at `~/.claude/skills/agentchrome/SKILL.md`
- When: `agentchrome skill uninstall`
- Then: stdout contains `{"tool":"claude-code","path":"~/.claude/skills/agentchrome/SKILL.md","action":"uninstalled"}`

### AC5: Update installed skill

**Given** an agentchrome skill was previously installed and the agentchrome version has changed
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill update`
**Then** the installed skill file is replaced with the current version's content and a JSON confirmation is returned on stdout

**Example**:
- Given: Skill was installed with version 1.7.0, now running 1.8.0
- When: `agentchrome skill update`
- Then: stdout contains `{"tool":"claude-code","path":"~/.claude/skills/agentchrome/SKILL.md","action":"updated","version":"1.8.0"}`

### AC6: Unknown environment

**Given** no supported agentic tool can be detected
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill install` without `--tool`
**Then** the command exits with a non-zero exit code and a JSON error on stderr listing supported tools and their manual install paths

**Example**:
- Given: No agentic env vars set, no matching parent process, no tool config dirs found
- When: `agentchrome skill install`
- Then: exit code is 1, stderr contains `{"error":"no supported agentic tool detected","supported_tools":[...]}`

### AC7: Cross-validate install via list

**Given** a skill was installed via `agentchrome skill install --tool claude-code`
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill list`
**Then** the Claude Code entry in the list shows `"installed": true` indicating the skill file exists at the expected path

### AC8: Uninstall with explicit --tool flag

**Given** a skill was previously installed for Aider
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill uninstall --tool aider`
**Then** the installed Aider skill file is removed and a JSON confirmation is returned on stdout

### AC9: Install idempotency

**Given** a skill is already installed for a tool
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill install` for the same tool again
**Then** the command overwrites the existing file with the current version's content and returns a JSON confirmation with `"action":"installed"` (no error)

### AC10: Detection priority order

**Given** multiple agentic tool signals are present (e.g., `CLAUDE_CODE` env var and `~/.continue/` directory both exist)
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill install`
**Then** the tool detected via the highest-priority signal (env vars first, then parent process, then config dirs) is selected

### AC11: README features skill install in setup

**Given** a user or AI agent reads the project README
**When** they look at the setup/quickstart section
**Then** `agentchrome skill install` is prominently featured as the recommended first step for AI agent integration, ahead of manual configuration, and `agentchrome skill update` is documented as the way to refresh the skill after upgrading agentchrome

### AC13: Gemini skill installs successfully

**Given** agentchrome is built with Gemini support
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill install --tool gemini`
**Then** a standalone skill file is created at `~/.gemini/instructions/agentchrome.md` containing the standard skill template with the current version

**Example**:
- When: `agentchrome skill install --tool gemini`
- Then: stdout contains `{"tool":"gemini","path":"~/.gemini/instructions/agentchrome.md","action":"installed","version":"..."}`

### AC14: Gemini appears in skill list

**Given** agentchrome supports Gemini
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill list`
**Then** the JSON output includes a `gemini` entry with the correct path (`~/.gemini/instructions/agentchrome.md`), detection description, and installed status

### AC15: Gemini auto-detection works

**Given** a `GEMINI_*` environment variable (e.g. `GEMINI_API_KEY`) is set, or `~/.gemini/` directory exists
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill install` without `--tool`
**Then** Gemini is detected and the skill is installed to `~/.gemini/instructions/agentchrome.md`

### AC16: Gemini skill uninstalls cleanly

**Given** the Gemini skill is installed at `~/.gemini/instructions/agentchrome.md`
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill uninstall --tool gemini`
**Then** the file is removed and empty parent directories are cleaned up

### AC17: Gemini skill updates in place

**Given** the Gemini skill is already installed
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill update --tool gemini`
**Then** the skill file is overwritten with the latest version content

### AC18: README lists Gemini as a supported tool

**Given** the project README.md documents the skill installer
**When** a user reads the supported tools section
**Then** Gemini CLI is listed alongside the other 6 tools with its install path and detection method

### AC12: All subcommand JSON output compliance

**Given** any `agentchrome skill` subcommand is invoked
**When** the command completes (success or error)
**Then** success output is JSON on stdout and error output is JSON on stderr, consistent with the global output contract

### AC19: Codex skill installs explicitly

**Given** no particular agentic environment is active
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill install --tool codex`
**Then** the command exits 0
**And** stdout contains JSON with `"tool": "codex"` and `"action": "installed"`
**And** AgentChrome writes `SKILL.md` to `$CODEX_HOME/skills/agentchrome/SKILL.md` when `CODEX_HOME` is set
**And** AgentChrome writes `SKILL.md` to `~/.codex/skills/agentchrome/SKILL.md` when `CODEX_HOME` is not set

### AC20: Codex appears in skill list

**Given** the skill command is available
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill list`
**Then** stdout contains JSON with a `tools` array
**And** the array includes an entry with `"name": "codex"`
**And** the Codex entry includes `detection`, `path`, and `installed` fields
**And** `installed` reflects whether the Codex skill file exists at the resolved install path

### AC21: Codex auto-detection works

**Given** Codex-specific signals are present, such as `CODEX_HOME` or an existing `~/.codex/` directory
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill install` without `--tool`
**Then** Codex is selected when no higher-priority explicit tool signal applies
**And** the skill is installed to the resolved Codex skill path
**And** stdout reports `"tool": "codex"`

### AC22: Codex lifecycle commands work

**Given** a Codex skill was previously installed
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill update --tool codex`
**Then** the skill file is rewritten with the current AgentChrome skill template
**And** stdout reports `"action": "updated"`

**Given** a Codex skill was previously installed
**When** the user runs `agentchrome skill uninstall --tool codex`
**Then** the Codex skill file is removed
**And** stdout reports `"action": "uninstalled"`

### AC23: Staleness check includes Codex

**Given** an installed Codex skill has an older embedded version than the AgentChrome binary
**When** any `agentchrome` command is invoked
**Then** stderr contains exactly one staleness notice line using the existing format
**And** the notice names `codex` when only the Codex skill is stale
**And** the notice includes `codex` in the aggregated stale-tool list when multiple skills are stale
**And** existing suppression via `AGENTCHROME_NO_SKILL_CHECK=1` and config still applies

### AC24: Documentation and tests cover Codex

**Given** Codex support is implemented
**When** the README, Codex guide, examples, and BDD tests are reviewed
**Then** Codex is documented as a supported skill installer target
**And** the docs show `agentchrome skill install --tool codex`
**And** focused BDD or unit tests cover install, list, detection, update, uninstall, and staleness behavior for Codex

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- [x] CLI framework (clap) — already in place
- [x] JSON output infrastructure — already in place
- [x] Error types (`AppError`, exit codes) — already in place

### External Dependencies
